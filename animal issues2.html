	<h1>what is an endangered species?</h1>
	<p  stylefont-size:largest>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land development, or creat protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.</p>

	<h1> The most famous endangered species </h1>
	<p>
		<center>
	   <h2> 1.Giant panda </h2>
		<img src="IMAGE\Giant Panda.jfif" width="200" height="400"></center>
		<p>Pandas are one of the most easily recognized animals on earth, thanks to their bold black and white coloration. Since almost all other bears have just one solid coat color, pandas are highly unusual-looking. They are also unique in other ways. For example, the diets of most bears are comprised of plant material, such as berries, and other animals, such as fish or insects. Pandas exclusively eat bamboo. Unfortunately, these fascinating bears are highly endangered due to habitat loss and other issues. </p>

		<h2>2.Tiger</h2>

		<p>The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. Several factors contribute to tigers being classified as endangered, these include poaching, illegal trade of tiger parts, loss of habitat, human conflict, and climate change.</p>

		<h2>3.Blue whale</h2>
        <img src="IMAGE\Blue Whale.jfif" width="200" height="400"></center>
