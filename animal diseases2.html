<h2>Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.
Treats should be<mark> no more than 5-10% of the diet.</mark>
Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of <i>anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting </i>or lethargy continue for more than two days.
Please visit our People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets page for a list of off-limits items, as well as our Cat Nutrition Tips page for more information.</h2>

<h2>A litter box, sometimes called a sandbox, cat box, litter tray, cat pan, or litter pan, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats, as well as rabbits, ferrets, miniature pigs, small dogs, and other pets that instinctively or through training will make use of such a repository</h2>

<h2>All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week; you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. Don't use ammonia, deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box. If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian. Sometimes refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical condition that required treatment. Please visit our Litter Box Problems page for more information.  </h2>

<h2>Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.</h2>

<h2>Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to recognize and fight a particular microorganism such as a virus, bacteria, or other infectious organism. Once vaccinated, the animal's immune system is then primed, or prepared to react to a future infection with that microorganism. In other words, the vaccine mimics a true infection so that the immune system can better protect the body in the future.</h2>
<center><img src="https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/o8XvdOSY1yQxjAJj4SwtHJQei04=/2667x2000/smart/filters:no_upscale()/kitten-vaccination-schedule-4165446_v3-1aedbc8477bc4514909e737f78eee2ab.png" height="400px"  width="500px" alt=""></center>
<h2>Cat vaccinations stimulate your kitten or cat's immune system in order to create protection from specific infectious diseases. This can cause mild symptoms to occur ranging from soreness at the injection site to fever and allergic reactions. Cat vaccinations can cause other risks like injection site tumors and immune disease, however such incidences are extremely rare and can be linked to pre-existing genetic and medical conditions. Because of the potential for injection site reactions, we give each vaccine in a specific location that is noted in the cat's medical record.
The fact is, the rewards of cat vaccinations far outweigh any risks. Cat vaccines have saved countless lives and play a vital role in the battle against feline infectious disease. As with any medical procedure, there is a small chance of negative side effects. In most cases, the risks are much smaller than the risks of disease itself</h2>

<h2>Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options . Fleas and ticks are a source of annoyance and potential health threat in every part of the US. While the seasons will affect the activity of these insects, it is possible to pick up fleas or ticks during most of the year. This is especially true because these insects can thrive in our homes. Dogs and cats which spend time outdoors are at equal risk of picking up fleas. However, because dogs spend a larger amount of time outdoors, they are at a higher risk than cats for ticks. While not as common, fleas and ticks can also enter homes from visiting pets and on people's clothes.</h2>

Fleas and ticks can also result in transmission of disease to humans through petting and sharing a living space with a host dog. This is why it is critical that you are aware of the health dangers that fleas and ticks can pose. It is important that you take measures to reduce the risk of an infestation. WIth the right plan and products, flea and tick infestation is easily preventable. Our veterinarians are here to help you develop a flea and tick prevention program that will best suit your needs and lifestyle.</h2>

<center><img src="https://villagevet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Dog-body-1.jpg" height="400px" width="500px"alt=""></center>
<h2>When you first bring home your new pet, one of the best ways to give them a healthy start is to spay or neuter them.
Spaying or neutering will benefit your pet medically and behaviorally. Whether you are doing it for the greater good or for the good of your pet, spaying your female pet or neutering your male pet has many advantages.
While you can have your pet spayed or neutered at almost any time, the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) recommends that you sterilize your cat by 5 months of age. This gives your cat the benefits of being spayed or neutered while still allowing your kitten time to grow.
For dogs, the AAHA recommends that small-breed dogs which will weigh less than 45 pounds as an adult are spayed before they go into heat at 5 or 6 months, or neutered by 6 months. Large-breed dogs that will weigh over 45 pounds as adults should be neutered when they finish growing by around 9 to 15 months of age, and spayed between 5 to 15 months.
Your vet can help you select the best time, which may depend on various factors.</h2>

<h2>Spaying your kitten when she is 3 to 6 months old will virtually eliminate the risk that she will develop mammary cancer when she's older. Additionally, spaying your kitten prevents many different infections and cancers that occur in the uterus and ovaries.
A study of 460,000 cats and 2.2 million dogs found that spayed cats live 39% longer and spayed dogs live 23% longer than their unspayed counterparts. Like cats, spayed dogs are less likely to develop certain cancers, as well as pyometra, a potentially fatal uterine infection.

<h2>Depending on your locality, some infections may be more or less likely. The range of vaccines available includes rabies, distemper, adenovirus (infectious canine hepatitis), parvovirus, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, coronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Lyme disease, and canine influenza (for details on these diseases, see individual handouts “Rabies in Dogs”, “Distemper in Dogs”, “Infectious Hepatitis (Adenovirus) in Dogs”, “Parvovirus in Dogs”, “Leptospirosis in Dogs”, “Kennel Cough or Tracheobronchitis in Dogs”, “Lyme Disease in Dogs”, and “Canine Influenza – The Dog Flu”). These vaccines are often available in combinations that can be given in one dose. Combination vaccines are convenient and avoid extra injections for your dog. Your veterinarian will advise you on the appropriate vaccines for your pet based on your dog's relative risks and specific lifestyle.

<h5 style ="color: black">Some horses are easier to feed and require fewer nutrients than others. Other horses are very difficult to feed and require special attention. It is important to know how to feed your horse and to make sure it gets all the nutrients it needs.
Understanding the function of the horse's gastrointestinal (GI) tract is critical for maintaining its health and preventing conditions such laminitis.Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract
Forty-five to 72 hours is required for food to completely pass through the digestive tract of the horse. A horse's GI tract consists of:
<mark>the mouth
esophagus
stomach
small intestine
cecum
large colon
small colon
rectum.</mark>
The stomach and the small intestine make up the foregut of the horse; the cecum, large colon, small colon and rectum make up the hindgut of the horse. The majority of starch (the principle component of cereal grains metabolized for energy), protein, fat, vitamins and minerals are digested and absorbed in the foregut (primarily in the small intestine) by enzymes and other digestive substances secreted into the small intestine by the pancreas, liver and cells making up the wall of the small intestine.
The hindgut contains microbes, which are bacteria and protozoa capable of digesting dietary fiber supplied by roughages in the diet. The horse does not produce enzymes which digest fiber, but uses microbes to break down fiber. Microbes enable horses to utilize fiber quite well.</h5>

<h5 style ="color:black">Horses with balance hooves move better, and have less stress and strain on bones, tendons and ligaments. The ideal foot has:
A straight hoof-pastern angle
A straight line from the pastern down through the front of the hoof wall.
This correctly lines up the bones between the pastern and coffin bone.
Easy break over
The toe is not too long and is squared, rounded or rolled.
This allows easier movement with each step.
Too much break over can result in health problems.
Adequate heel support
The shoe extends back to the end of the hoof wall and supports the back of the entire leg.
The back edge of the shoe is under a line drawn down the center of the cannon bone.
Medial-lateral balance
The foot lands evenly from side to side as the horse walks.</h5>

Imbalanced hooves
Causes stress on supporting ligaments and joints. Hot nail
A hot nail is a horseshoe nail within a sensitive area of the horse’s hoof. Hot nails will generally cause lameness.
Treatments include:
Cleaning the nail hole with antiseptic, a wash that prevents germ growth
Packing the hole or bandaging the foot
Providing a Tetanus booster
Street nail
A street nail is any foreign object that enters the horse’s foot. Call your veterinarian immediately if your horse has a street nail. Treatment will depend on the location of the injury.
Laminitis and founder
Laminitis is swelling of the sensitive laminae. The lamina is a connective tissue located inside the hoof. Swelling causes the coffin bone to rotate or sink downward within the hoof. There are several causes of laminitis.
Treatments include:
Regular shoeing or trimming
Keeping short toes
Keeping frog and sole support  </h5>

<h5 style="color:black">THE HORSE'S MOUTH Horses evolved as grazing animals, and their teeth are perfectly adapted for that purpose. The forward teeth, known as incisors, function to shear off forage. The cheek teeth, including the molars and premolars with their wide, flat, graveled surfaces, easily grind the feed to a mash before it is swallowed.
Like humans, horses get two sets of teeth in their lifetime. The baby teeth, also called deciduous teeth, are temporary. The first deciduous incisors may erupt before the foal is born. The last baby teeth come in when the horse is about 8 months of age. These teeth begin to be replaced by adult teeth around age 2 1/2. By age 5, most horses have their full complement of permanent teeth. An adult male horse has 40 permanent teeth. A mare may have between 36-40, because mares are less likely to have canine (bridle) teeth.
The following chart shows the approximate ages at which different teeth erupt. By referring to it, you may detect potential abnormalities of your own horse associated with teething. For more information, refer to the Official Guide for Determining the Age of the Horse, published by the AAEP.

<center><img src="https://equinediseasecc.org/Content/ContentImages/CORE%20VACCINATION.jpg" height="500px" width="600px"alt=""></center>
<h5>Basic or Core Vaccines
The basic or core vaccines are those vaccines that provide protection against the diseases that have significant health risk to the horse and/or to humans through contact. These are the "no-brainers." All horses should be vaccinated with these vaccines. They include rabies, tetanus and West Nile virus. It could be easily argued that Eastern equine encephalitis should be added to this list, based on the occurrence of eleven cases of this disease in the mosquito season of 2003.
Rabies is a well-known cause of fatal disease in many mammals. The virus is transmitted through bite wounds by affected animals such as foxes, skunks, racoons and bats, though other mammals may transmit the virus. In 2001, five cases of rabies in horses were diagnosed. In 2002, one case of rabies in a horse occurred. Rabies is a rapidly progressive disease that is preventable by vaccination. Rabies vaccines are licensed for use annually in horses and must be administered by a licensed veterinarian.
Tetanus or lockjaw is an often fatal disease caused by the anaerobic bacteria (grows in low oxygen conditions), Clostridium tetani. The spores of Cl. tetani are commonly present in the soil and can contaminate puncture wounds, crushing wounds, open lacerations, surgical incisions and the umbilici of foals. Upon gaining entrance to the body, Cl. tetani produces a powerful neurotoxin, which blocks neurotransmission, resulting in unopposed muscle contraction and spasm (tetany). Horses of all ages can be affected. Horses are the most susceptible of all of the animal species. All adult horses should initially be vaccinated for tetanus twice, three to six weeks apart, using tetanus toxoid and boostered annually or as recommended by their veterinarian. Tetanus antitoxin is administered to non-immunized horses (or ones where their immune status is unknown) that sustain a wound that has become contaminated. It is prepared from the blood of healthy, hyperimmunized horses and provides immediate passive immunity lasting 7-14 days. </h5>

<h5>Talk with your vet about which grain or hay to use and how much to feed your cattle. Pastured cattle can survive by primarily eating grass. However, if your cattle are primarily in a dry-lot or if the weather is poor, then supplementing with grain or hay is a good idea. [8]
Use a hay rack or clean feed container in a paddock or barn to give your cattle hay or grain. Wet, moldy food can actually sicken your animals. If the hay or grain gets wet, discard it immediately.
Feeding your cattle grain helps you to form a positive relationship with them, too. They’ll associate you with food and are more likely to come to your calls.</h5>

<h5>You can use a natural water source or a tank. If a stream or river runs through a paddock space, it can provide a source of water for your cattle. You can construct an access ramp, so that cows can access the water easier without polluting it. Or, you can use a siphon system to fill up water tanks from this source.[7]
Another alternative is to install an animal-operated pasture pump. This is a water pump that is triggered by a cow’s nose pressing against the lever in the water tank. Then, the water is automatically siphoned up from the river to fill the tank.
If you are using a freshwater spring or river as a water source, it’s important to clean it out periodically to ensure that it doesn’t become contaminated and spread disease.
As a general rule, cattle need daily access to between 1-2 gallons of fresh water per 100 pounds of body weight. This means that you’ll want at least 1 tank per paddock that can hold the minimal amount of daily water for the animals in that space.</h5>

<h5>This is the minimum amount of space you’ll need, but you can use more. If you’re letting your cattle rely primarily on field roughage (grass) for food all year round, you’ll need room for them to graze. This estimate takes into account the fact that grass production slows in the winter months.[1]
More space is even better since it gives you a safety net in the event of any grass problems or drought.</h5>

To produce an effective protocol that matches your system’s risks and logistics, consult with your veterinarian.

<h5>Types of Vaccines
Most vaccines contain either modified live, killed, or chemically altered organisms. If a vaccine is used correctly, whether it is modified live, killed, or chemically altered, it will increase an animal’s resistance to disease, but each type of vaccine does have its limitations as well.
Modified live vaccines (MLV) contain a small amount of virus or bacteria that has been altered so that it does not cause clinical disease when used according to product label directions. However, the virus or bacteria can still replicate in the vaccinated animal resulting in a controlled infection. Recognition of the replicating organism by the animal’s immune system stimulates an effective immune response. MLVs are mainly available for diseases caused by viruses, such as bovine herpes virus 1, the causative agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and parainfluenza-3 virus (Pl3). Some MLVs are safe for use in pregnant cows if you follow all label directions. However, if not used according to label directions, MLVs can cause abortion in pregnant cows (table 1). In addition, some MLVs are not approved for use in calves nursing pregnant cows because of the slight possibility that the calves could temporarily shed the vaccine virus and infect the cows. However, some MLVs can be safely used in calves nursing pregnant cows if the cows have been properly vaccinated according to label directions. MLVs are also safe to use in weaned calves, including replacement heifers.</h5>
