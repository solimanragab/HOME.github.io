<h2><font color="black">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most commonly diagnosed cardiac disease in cats. Feline Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition that causes the muscular walls of a cat’s heart to thicken, decreasing the heart’s efficiency and sometimes creating symptoms in other parts of the body. Although the cause of HCM has not been clearly identified, the fact that the condition is more prevalent in certain breeds (including Maine Coon, Ragdoll, British Shorthair, Sphynx, Chartreux and Persian cats) and that mutations of several cardiac (heart) genes have been identified in some cats with this disease suggests that genetics plays a role.</p></h2>

<h2>While the disease’s effects and prognosis (predicted outcome) may vary considerably, proper diagnosis and treatment can decrease the chance that a cat with HCM will experience certain symptoms and can improve his or her quality of life.
In a cat with HCM, the heart’s left ventricle (its primary “pump muscle”) is thickened, leading to a decrease in the volume of the heart chamber and to abnormal relaxation of the heart muscle. These changes can cause the heart to beat rapidly, resulting in increased oxygen usage and possibly to oxygen starvation of the heart muscle. This oxygen starvation may cause heart cells to die off, worsening heart function and leading to the development of arrhythmias (in which the heart beats too rapidly, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm).
In addition to these difficulties, less efficient blood pumping may also lead to a backup of blood to the other chambers of the heart and to the lungs, which may contribute to the development of congestive heart failure or the formation of blood clots in the heart.</h2>

<h2>Although observed in humans and cats, ectopia lentis is most commonly seen in dogs. Ciliary zonules normally hold the lens in place. Abnormal development of these zonules can lead to primary ectopia lentis, usually a bilateral condition. Luxation can also be a secondary condition, caused by trauma, cataract formation (decrease in lens diameter may stretch and break the zonules), or glaucoma (enlargement of the globe stretches the zonules). Steroid administration weakens the zonules and can lead to luxation, as well. Lens luxation in cats can occur secondary to anterior uveitis (inflammation of the inside of the eye)</h2>

<p><h2>Giardiasis is an intestinal infection in humans and animals, caused by a microscopic protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis (also known as G. intestinalis or G. lamblia).
"Giardia is not a "worm", bacteria or virus."
Giardia is a simple one-celled parasitic species; <mark>it is not a "worm", bacteria or virus.</mark> There are seven genotypes, A through G, with dogs being most commonly infected by C and D, cats with F, and humans most commonly infected with A and B. Genotype E and F are rarely reported. The parasite occurs worldwide and is a common cause of "Traveler's Diarrhea" in people. Outdoor enthusiasts who inadvertently consume contaminated water may develop "beaver fever", which is another name for giardiasis in people. Other examples of protozoan parasites that can cause enteric (intestinal) disease are Coccidia, Cryptosporidia and Toxoplasma.</p></h2>

<p><h2>A dog becomes infected with Giardia when it swallows the cyst stage of the parasite. In susceptible dogs, once the cyst passes into the dog's intestines, it goes through a transformation to the trophozoite, or feeding form, and attaches to the intestinal wall to feed. If sufficient numbers are present, clinical signs of damage to the intestinal wall will develop.
Trophozoites reproduce by dividing, and some transform into the cystic form. Eventually, the dog passes infectious cysts in its stool. The time it takes from ingestion of cysts to passage in feces is 5 to 12 days in dogs and 5 to 16 days in cats.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Rabies is an incurable virus that attacks the brain and spinal cord. All mammals, including dogs and humans, can catch rabies.
While it’s preventable and even treatable if caught early on, once the symptoms of rabies appear, the virus is fatal.
How Can My Dog Get Rabies
Rabies is secreted in saliva, so it’s most often passed through a bite wound from an infected animal. When a bite breaks the skin, the virus can enter the bloodstream. It can also pass through an open wound that is exposed to the saliva of an infected animal, usually by licking.
While it can pass between pets, rabies in dogs most frequently comes from exposure to wild animals like bats, raccoons, and foxes.
Each year, about <mark>400 to 500 cases</mark> of rabies are reported in domestic pets like cats, dogs, and ferrets. Rabies isn’t particularly common in dogs in the United States, because it is 100% preventable with vaccination.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Rabies is not easily diagnosed by a blood test. To be 100% accurate, testing requires a biopsy of brain tissue, so it can’t be completed until the animal has died.
Once symptoms appear, there’s no way to treat rabies in dogs. Unfortunately, if your veterinarian suspects rabies, your dog may be euthanized since they could spread the virus.
If a wild animal bites your dog, a booster of the rabies vaccination may be given to lessen the chance that your dog will contract the virus.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), is a rare disease that causes inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). It is caused by an arbovirus, which means it is spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It was first seen in horses (equine) in the 1830s and first diagnosed in a human along the east coast in the 1930s. The virus can only be spread to humans through a mosquito bite. It cannot be spread from human to human or from horse or other animal to a human.Certain types of mosquitoes become infected by feeding on birds infected with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. These mosquitoes then bite humans and animals. The birds themselves originally became infected by being bit by yet a different species of mosquito.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Eastern equine encephalitis is diagnosed through bloodwork. Testing can include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to identify the EEE virus.Eastern Equine Encephalitis is a viral disease caused by infected mosquitoes. When an EEE-infected mosquito bites a non-immune horse (or human), the virus spreads through the body and attacks the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) causing nervous signs such as profound depression, blindness, staggering and even seizures. Most affected horses die within several days. All horses are at risk although young adults (six months to two years) are particularly vulnerable.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Amnitis or hoof fever is a difficult disease that affects the hoof and is described as severe lameness.. This disease is familiar to most horse breeders. His name alone causes concern to the owner of the horse and the veterinarian.
Although the spread of this disease for a very long time, the complications that occur in men are not entirely clear and treatment is not always useful.
There are many medicines available in the market for treatment, and these medicines are sometimes anti-toxin to each other.
At the slightest suspicion when infected with hoof fever, contact the veterinarian immediately because the disease is considered an emergency.

3_ Treatment with phenylbutazone, which is anti-pain and anti-inflammatory
4_ Raise the heel by placing a lilipad under it
5_ Reducing the amount of concentrated food to a minimum

<p><h2>Rinderpest, also known as cattle plague, is a contagious viral disease affecting clovenhoofed animals (mainly cattle and buffalo). In 2011, rinderpest became the second
disease to be declared officially eradicated, following eradication of the human disease
smallpox in 1980.
Rinderpest is caused by a virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Morbillivirus. Many
species of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals (including sheep and goats) show
only mild symptoms of the disease when infected, but for cattle and buffalo, mortality
rates can reach up to 100 per cent in highly susceptible herds.
The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code contains detailed recommendations on the
prevention and control of rinderpest, in the event that there is a recurrence of the disease.
Rinderpest is one of seven diseases for which the OIE had established official recognition
of the sanitary status procedures for countries and zones.
Rinderpest remains a notifiable disease to the OIE, and adequate surveillance systems
must be maintained to ensure early detection of clinical cases, should there be any
accidental or intentional escape of the virus from high-containment storage facilities.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Rinderpest (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an infectious viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, and many other species of even-toed ungulates, including gaurs, buffaloes, large antelope, deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations.[3] Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although it could also be transmitted by air.[4] After a global eradication campaign since the mid-20th century, the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001.</p></h2>

<p><h2>Because anthrax is a soil borne disease, beef cattle and bison are most likely to contract the disease because they graze lower to the ground than many other herbivores, particularly in drought conditions or overgrazed pastures. It is also believed that the abrasive forages they consume can injure the mouth and allow the bacteria quick access to the blood stream.
Three types of anthrax:
Gastrointestinal: Caused when bacteria spores from an infected animal are ingested. The most common cause of anthrax in beef cattle.
Cutaneous: Contracted via a skin wound. The most common way that anthrax is contracted by people.
Pulmonary: Caused when the bacteria are inhaled. This type is the most dangerous, but is virtually impossible for animals to contract under natural conditions. This type of anthrax occurs in rare situations where people are working directly with contaminated hides.
When an animal dies of anthrax, the bacteria is present in most tissues of the body. If the tissues are not exposed to oxygen, the bacteria cannot form the spores that infect other animals, and quickly die off. However, in most cases scavengers or carnivores open the carcass soon after death. This exposes the bacteria to oxygen, allowing infectious spores to form.</p></h2>
<center> <img src="https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/images/illustrations/anthrax-life-process.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="500px"></center
<p><h2>Anthrax in cattle has a very rapid onset. Once spores have been ingested, they infect macrophages (cells that are formed by the immune system in response to an infection), germinate and begin to multiply. The cells then produce a lethal toxin that kills body cells and causes excess fluid to accumulate in body tissues. Once the bacteria begin to multiply in the lymph nodes, the level of toxins in the body increase rapidly and cause tissue damage and organ failure. It is believed that the disease symptoms only last for 2-3 hours, so the most common symptom is sudden death. Very rarely observed symptoms are:
trembling
high temperature
difficulty breathing
convolutions and collapsing before death.</p></h2>
