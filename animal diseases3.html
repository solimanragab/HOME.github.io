<h2>Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.
Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.
Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.
Please visit our People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets page for a list of off-limits items, as well as our Cat Nutrition Tips page for more information.</h2>

<h2>A litter box, sometimes called a sandbox, cat box, litter tray, cat pan, or litter pan, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats, as well as rabbits, ferrets, miniature pigs, small dogs, and other pets that instinctively or through training will make use of such a repository</h2>
<center><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9e/Clean-a-Litter-Box-Step-12.jpg/v4-460px-Clean-a-Litter-Box-Step-12.jpg" height="400px"  width="500px" alt=""></center>
<h2>All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week; you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. Don't use ammonia, deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box. If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian. Sometimes refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical condition that required treatment. Please visit our Litter Box Problems page for more information.  </h2>
<font color ="blue" size ="6">(3)Scratching:</font>

<h2>Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.</h2>

<center><img src="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/12136/cat-vaccinations-og.jpg" height="400px"  width="500px" alt=""></center>
<h2>Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to recognize and fight a particular microorganism such as a virus, bacteria, or other infectious organism. Once vaccinated, the animal's immune system is then primed, or prepared to react to a future infection with that microorganism. In other words, the vaccine mimics a true infection so that the immune system can better protect the body in the future.</h2>
<center><img src="https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/o8XvdOSY1yQxjAJj4SwtHJQei04=/2667x2000/smart/filters:no_upscale()/kitten-vaccination-schedule-4165446_v3-1aedbc8477bc4514909e737f78eee2ab.png" height="400px"  width="500px" alt=""></center>
<h2>Cat vaccinations stimulate your kitten or cat's immune system in order to create protection from specific infectious diseases. This can cause mild symptoms to occur ranging from soreness at the injection site to fever and allergic reactions. Cat vaccinations can cause other risks like injection site tumors and immune disease, however such incidences are extremely rare and can be linked to pre-existing genetic and medical conditions. Because of the potential for injection site reactions, we give each vaccine in a specific location that is noted in the cat's medical record.
The fact is, the rewards of cat vaccinations far outweigh any risks. Cat vaccines have saved countless lives and play a vital role in the battle against feline infectious disease. As with any medical procedure, there is a small chance of negative side effects. In most cases, the risks are much smaller than the risks of disease itself</h2>

<h2>Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.
Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.</h2>

<h2>Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options . Fleas and ticks are a source of annoyance and potential health threat in every part of the US. While the seasons will affect the activity of these insects, it is possible to pick up fleas or ticks during most of the year. This is especially true because these insects can thrive in our homes. Dogs and cats which spend time outdoors are at equal risk of picking up fleas. However, because dogs spend a larger amount of time outdoors, they are at a higher risk than cats for ticks. While not as common, fleas and ticks can also enter homes from visiting pets and on people's clothes.</h2>

<h2>Skin irritation and infection
Rashes and red inflamed skin
Scabs and scales
Transmission of disease and illness to you and your dog
Psychological issues from constant scratching
Fleas and ticks can also result in transmission of disease to humans through petting and sharing a living space with a host dog. This is why it is critical that you are aware of the health dangers that fleas and ticks can pose. It is important that you take measures to reduce the risk of an infestation. WIth the right plan and products, flea and tick infestation is easily preventable. Our veterinarians are here to help you develop a flea and tick prevention program that will best suit your needs and lifestyle.</h2>
<font color ="red" size ="6">(3)Spaying and Neutering:</font>
<center><img src="https://villagevet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Dog-body-1.jpg" height="400px" width="500px"alt=""></center>
<h2>When you first bring home your new pet, one of the best ways to give them a healthy start is to spay or neuter them.
Spaying or neutering will benefit your pet medically and behaviorally. Whether you are doing it for the greater good or for the good of your pet, spaying your female pet or neutering your male pet has many advantages.
While you can have your pet spayed or neutered at almost any time, the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) recommends that you sterilize your cat by 5 months of age. This gives your cat the benefits of being spayed or neutered while still allowing your kitten time to grow.
For dogs, the AAHA recommends that small-breed dogs which will weigh less than 45 pounds as an adult are spayed before they go into heat at 5 or 6 months, or neutered by 6 months. Large-breed dogs that will weigh over 45 pounds as adults should be neutered when they finish growing by around 9 to 15 months of age, and spayed between 5 to 15 months.
Your vet can help you select the best time, which may depend on various factors.</h2>

<h2>Spaying your kitten when she is 3 to 6 months old will virtually eliminate the risk that she will develop mammary cancer when she's older. Additionally, spaying your kitten prevents many different infections and cancers that occur in the uterus and ovaries.
A study of 460,000 cats and 2.2 million dogs found that spayed cats live 39% longer and spayed dogs live 23% longer than their unspayed counterparts. Like cats, spayed dogs are less likely to develop certain cancers, as well as pyometra, a potentially fatal uterine infection.

<h2>Depending on your locality, some infections may be more or less likely. The range of vaccines available includes rabies, distemper, adenovirus (infectious canine hepatitis), parvovirus, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, coronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Lyme disease, and canine influenza (for details on these diseases, see individual handouts “Rabies in Dogs”, “Distemper in Dogs”, “Infectious Hepatitis (Adenovirus) in Dogs”, “Parvovirus in Dogs”, “Leptospirosis in Dogs”, “Kennel Cough or Tracheobronchitis in Dogs”, “Lyme Disease in Dogs”, and “Canine Influenza – The Dog Flu”). These vaccines are often available in combinations that can be given in one dose. Combination vaccines are convenient and avoid extra injections for your dog. Your veterinarian will advise you on the appropriate vaccines for your pet based on your dog's relative risks and specific lifestyle.
Core vaccines. Recommended for all puppies and dogs by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccine Task Force:
canine distemper virus
canine parvovirus

<h2>Types of feeds
Your horse can get its essential nutrients from many types of feed.
Roughage/Forage Roughage, found in hay or grass, is the bulk of the horse's food. Grass or alfalfa hay, or a combination of the two, are good sources of roughage. Grass hay is generally higher in fiber and dry matter than alfalfa, but alfalfa may be higher in protein, energy, vitamins and calcium. Hay can be long-stemmed in hay bales, or come bagged in cubes, or pellets. Many horse owners feed grass hay or straight alfalfa or a combination of grass and alfalfa to their horses. Grasses commonly used as hay are brome, orchard, and timothy.
Long stem hay is the traditional baled hay. It is cut, cured, and baled. It can be bundled in 50- to 80-pound square bales or large, round or long square bales that can weigh tons.
Hay cubes are about an inch wide and 1- to 3-inches long.
Hay pellets are ground hay compressed into 2 inch by ½ inch pellets.</h2>

<h2>Hoof Care
Hooves should be trimmed every six to eight weeks. Depending on your horse’s activity level, the environment and his body type, your horse may need shoes. Your farrier will be able to recommend the best course of action to keep your horse’s hooves strong and well-balanced.Horse hooves are constantly growing, much like our own nails. So, how do you take care of a horse’s hooves? With the aid of a good farrier. A farrier specializes in equine hoof care, from trimming hooves, to fitting horseshoes, to dealing with certain injuries.</h2>
<center><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718S45H4J5L.gif" height="400px" width="500px"alt=""></center>
<h2>Contrary to popular belief, not all horses wear shoes. In fact, the prevailing belief is that barefoot is better for the horse in many instances. While horseshoes do protect the hooves, and may be required in certain breeds with weak hoof strength, most pleasure horses can do without.
That being said, it’s advisable to have the farrier out every six to eight weeks to inspect and trim your horse’s hooves. They need to be kept balanced so that they can retain a natural, unimpeded gait.
Should horseshoeing be necessary, know that it is not painful for the horse. The outer hoof has no feeling; only the inner soft part of the hoof is sensitive. Shoes can be nailed or glued on, depending on the needs of the horse and the farrier’s recommendation. Alternately there is such a thing as hoof boots that can be worn when riding the horse.</h2>

<h2>Horse's teeth need to be checked by a trained and competent equine dentist at least once a year for a horse kept in a paddock. Unchecked teeth can become sharp, causing pain and mouth injuries.
Horses under the age of 5, as well as grain fed horses, need a dental check at least once every 3 to 6 months.</h2>

<h2>THE HORSE'S MOUTH
Horses evolved as grazing animals, and their teeth are perfectly adapted for that purpose. The forward teeth, known as incisors, function to shear off forage. The cheek teeth, including the molars and premolars with their wide, flat, graveled surfaces, easily grind the feed to a mash before it is swallowed.
Like humans, horses get two sets of teeth in their lifetime. The baby teeth, also called deciduous teeth, are temporary. The first deciduous incisors may erupt before the foal is born. The last baby teeth come in when the horse is about 8 months of age. These teeth begin to be replaced by adult teeth around age 2 1/2. By age 5, most horses have their full complement of permanent teeth. An adult male horse has 40 permanent teeth. A mare may have between 36-40, because mares are less likely to have canine (bridle) teeth.</h2>

<h2>Cattle are ruminants, so they have four stomachs. It’s important to feed them correctly to encourage the right balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut to facilitate their multi-step digestion processes.
When dealing with new cattle, it’s important to find out what they’ve been eating and lay in a supply of that feed at least for the first few weeks. Make any changes in feeding very gradually over the first 7 to 10 days.
Changing feed abruptly can throw the helpful gut bacteria off balance and causes undesirable changes in the pH level of the cows digestive juices.
You may be surprised at how much cattle can eat. Cattle being raised for meat production or milk production need to eat about 3% of their total body weight in feed daily.</h2>

<h2>Cattle often struggle to get enough water during the winter. Water sources can freeze or are impossible to get to because of snow, ice or mud. Veterinarians say that each day cattle need between 1 and 2 gallons of water per 100 pounds of weight. That makes water an important resource in any weather condition, winter or not. A novice livestock manager may assume that cattle can eat snow or lick ice to reach their normal limit, but that’s simply not the case. Doing so would take hours and reroute valuable body heat, leaving little time or energy to feed and grow.
Since dehydrated cattle are more at risk for colic and impaction, it’s important to maintain their water uptake and keep them healthy. The easiest solution is to install tank heaters in their water sources. When you do, make sure to follow manufacturer instructions to avoid accidental shocks or fires. If you can’t use a heater, be able to provide unfrozen water several times a day and in multiple locations.
By ensuring a regular water source, even when temperatures plummet below freezing, your cattle will continue to thrive -- a key sign of a happy animal.</h2>

<center><img src="https://www.quinns.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dairy-Cow-Calf.jpg" height="500px" width="600px"alt=""></center>
<h2>Life on the pasture is normally pretty good. Lots of food and plenty of space, but when a winter storm comes roaring in, getting to safety becomes top priority. Without it, cattle can stress over their well-being and panic.
Providing proper shelter for grazing cattle during cold weather is critical and can even reduce your feed costs, since chilled livestock will have increased energy requirements. Shelter can be provided in a variety of ways. Three-sided sheds placed throughout your pastures will allow cattle to escape harsh weather. Hills, gullies, thickets of trees and shelterbelts can also work as wind breaks.
It’s also important to pay attention to the weather forecast. When you know there’s a winter storm coming, it’s best to keep cattle close to the barn or near a shelter. That’s one of the benefits of temporary electric fencing – you can control where your cattle are at all times.</h2

To produce an effective protocol that matches your system’s risks and logistics, consult with your veterinarian.
There are many different products available, and ultimately the choice of what to use will come down to efficacy, price, and personal preference. Knowing what products will fit your system best is also a question to ask your veterinarian.</h2>

<h2>Vaccine trade names can be confusing; however, the label will always specify which diseases and microorganisms the vaccine provides protection against. Sometimes different terms used in the name can be confusing as well. Terms such as 4-way, 5-way, 7-way, or 8-way do not refer to any particular type of vaccine, but rather to the number of different subtypes of a microorganism in a vaccine. These terms are most often used for leptospirosis or clostridial disease vaccines, which contain several subtypes of the Leptospira or Clostridium organisms.</h2>
