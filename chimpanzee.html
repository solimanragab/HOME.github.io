                    Compared with most other animals, chimpanzees are incredibly intelligent: They work with tools, communicate with complex vocalizations, and are good problem-solvers. But as smart as chimps are, their brain power pales in comparison with our own. A multitude of factors help makes the human brain superior to the chimps', but new research indicates that looser genetic control of brain development in humans allows us to learn and adapt to our environment with more flexibility than our primate cousins.

                    The neocortex—the outermost layer of the brain characterized by the squiggly sulci, or brain folds—is the region that gives all primates their exceptional intelligence. In both chimps and humans, this brain region continues to grow and organize for years after birth, allowing us to learn and develop socially. The brain's ability to reorganize in response to environmental cues is known as plasticity, and it is this flexibility that allows us to learn things we never knew at birth; how to tie our shoes, for example, or do calculus problems. Chimps demonstrate plasticity when they pick up things like cooperative grooming practices. But new research, published online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that genetics dictate the organization of a chimp's brain much more rigidly than in humans, allowing the environment to play a larger role in our neural development.</p>
